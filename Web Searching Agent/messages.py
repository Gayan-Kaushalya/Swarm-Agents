    {'content': 'Time series forecasting is a method of predicting future values in a dataset that exhibits temporal patterns, such as stock prices, weather, or website traffic. Here are some popular techniques used for time series forecasting:\n\n1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A statistical model that uses past values to forecast future ones.\n2. Exponential Smoothing (ES): A method that uses the average of past observations to forecast future values.\n3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed for time series forecasting.\n4. Prophet: An open-source software for forecasting time series data, developed by Airbnb.\n\nTools commonly used for time series forecasting include:\n\n1. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn\n2. Popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch\n3. Specialized libraries like Statsmodels, Scipy, and TsFresh\n\nSome common applications of time series forecasting include:\n\n1. Demand forecasting in supply chain management\n2. Stock market prediction\n3. Weather forecasting\n4. Traffic flow analysis',
